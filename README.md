# Student_Marks_Predictor

A machine learning project that predicts student exam marks based on various input features.  
The project includes model training in a Jupyter notebook, a Flask web app for predictions, and datasets for experimentation.

This project predicts a studentâ€™s final exam marks based on key academic and personal factors, using supervised machine learning. The aim is to show how data science can be applied in education to give early performance insights, help identify struggling students, and guide intervention strategies.

It covers the full pipeline: collecting and cleaning raw data, exploring patterns, training a regression model, saving the trained model, and building a Flask-powered web interface so non-technical users can run predictions instantly.
